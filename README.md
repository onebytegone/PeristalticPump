# Peristaltic Pump

I have been wanting an inexpensive peristaltic pump for a while. This is a basic mechanical engineering project to design and build one.


## Requirements

  * Cost of goods to be under $8 (This is for major costs, minor hardware does not count towards this)
  * 3D printing acceptable for manufacturing
  * Be able to pump at least 250ml per minute (Accuracy is preferred over speed)
  * Use common hardware (Consumer friendly retailer, e.g. [SparkFun](http://sparkfun.com)/[Pololu](http://pololu.com), or local hardware store)
  * Support for rotation tracking is not mandatory
  * Should operate in the range of 3v-12v (Support for the entire rage is not necessary)
  * Supports fluids the about the viscosity of water
  * Can be made food safe
