# Development Notes

## v0.2

  * Silicone tubing work much better than vinyl tubing
  * For pumping water, the hose needs to be completely compressed to create the needed suction
  * Rollers for the propeller are required
  * A couple extra mm of height for the compresstion channel may be helpful
  * A retaing rail to prevent the hose from walking out would be an improvement
  * The back wall needs to extend further along the perimeter. This is to help with keeping a constant suction
  * It might be possible to only have two arms on the propeller instead of 4


## v0.1

  * Vinyl tubing, such as aquarium air hose, is too stiff for this purpose
  * Without rollers on the propeller tips, a lot of force is needed to rotate the propller. This may just be caused by using vinyl tubing.
